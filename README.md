# MovieGenreClassifer
This project aims to develop a movie genre classification system based on a Large Language Model (LLM). Users can input a description of a movie, and the system will analyze the text to return a list of applicable genres.
## System Setup Instructions
To set up your system for the movie genre classification project, follow these steps:

1. **Set the API Key**: 
   - Open the source code file (main.ipynb) and set your API key in the first line. This key is essential for authenticating requests to any external services you may be using.

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: 
   - Install all necessary dependencies by running the `requirements.txt` file. Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - This will ensure that all required libraries are installed for the project.

3. **Execute the Code**: 
   - Run the main code file to start the application. Once executed, you can access the service at `https://127.0.0.1`, where you can input movie descriptions and receive a list of applicable genres in return.

By following these steps, your system will be properly configured to classify movie genres based on user input descriptions.
